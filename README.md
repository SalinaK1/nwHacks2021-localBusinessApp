## Idea

We, at Local aim at connecting local businesses with the customers. This notion arised from the ongoing sufferings of local businesses and hence as an effort to fight COVID-19, we here have done our bit to help community.

## Features

1. Location tracking using APIs to detect the location of user and then suggest the stores nearby
2. Interactive designs and notes to clearly convey the purpose of this project.
3. Collect data from user of his/her information and then parse it to back-end for the processing.

## Scalability

The project can be scaled for a large variety of local shops, each demarcated carefully with the category they fall in.
The project , being hosted as open source has the potential to make new-comers and beginners both in the world of web development and open-source.
